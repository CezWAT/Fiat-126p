First try to create better sunshield
------------------------------------
Pros:
1. Can move up/down and left/right.
2. Not made of foam.

Cons:
1. Too many screws.
2. It may be hard to find c-clip aka Seeger ring to fit in ABS parts, so no cutout made for that.
3. It may be hard to stiffen whole rod in ABS body.
